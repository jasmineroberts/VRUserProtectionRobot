# VR User Protection Robot

Use ToF sensors to sense the environments.

Advanced sensor fusion is used for localization with pose correction. 

Multiple sensors are used to increase the accuracy.

Dynamic map correction is performed while mapping.

Separate filters are implemented to remove sensor noise. 

Sensors are combined with a PID algorithm to follow walls.

Use geared motors with rotary encoders for precise maneuvers.

Accuracy â€“ 0.05 meters
